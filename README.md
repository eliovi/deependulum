# deependulum
Double Pendulum physics simulation using LSTM.

The goal of the project is to experiment with neural networks for modeling and simultaion of dynamic physical systems, and specifically with chatic systems. 

The network is trained in a supervised setting, using pre genereated dataset, which was created using numerical solution.
